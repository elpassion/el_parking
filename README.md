# Zero to Preact

This is the bare minimum you'll want in order to get up and running with Preact and Webpack 2.

Note that for most projects, you'll want to use [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli) to bootstrap your preact projects.

You don't need to clone this repository as a boilerplate - the [commit history](https://github.com/developit/zero-to-preact/commits/master) is actually a _step-by-step guide_! It will walk you through setting things up yourself.  Give it a try, you might be surprised how easy it is ðŸ™‚
